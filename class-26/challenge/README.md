# Challenge

Trees practice with Neetcode.

## Specifications

We're going to mix things up a little and step away from your usual Data Strucures & Algorithms repository and take a look at NeetCode.

[NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/){:target="_blank"} is a clever and helpful way to track your Data Structure & Algorithm practice in LeetCode.

Go the [practice page](https://neetcode.io/practice){:target="_blank"} and select the `NeetCode 150` collection.

From that collection select `Trees` category and sort by difficulty. Complete as many `easy tree` problems as you can in 2 hours, including watching the provided `video solution`.

As you complete each problem click the `submit` button to see how you did. **NOTE:** the url/s generated by clicking `submit` button is what you will use for Canvas assignment.

## Submission Instructions

Submit the url to all Leetcode submissions. The url will look something like `https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/submissions/123456789/`. They do **NOT** need to have been accepted by LeetCode.

## Stretch

- Publish your solution to LeetCode.
- Complete medium/hard problems.
