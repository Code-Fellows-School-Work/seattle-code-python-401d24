# Tips, Tricks and Useful Files

## GitBash Aliases

- On Windows we're using GitBash now. It works well enough but is missing a few bells and whistles compared to the Z Shell / Oh-My-Zsh tools used in earlier courses.
- Included in this folder is a `.bash_profile` file contains a big list of helpful aliases that came with Oh-My-Zsh.
- To get to home folder open GitBash and type `cd` and enter.
- If there is not already a `.bash_profile` there then copy the supplied `.bash_profile` to your home directory.
- If there is already a `.bash_profile` there then copy the contents of supplied `.bash_profile` and paste at bottom of file.
- Close and relaunch GitBash.
- Those aliases should now work for you.
